## Research professionals involved

### Camille Besse

Camille Besse holds a Ph.D. in sequential decision making in an uncertain context and has several years of experience in research, student supervision and teaching. He specializes in the development of solutions adapted to the needs of his clients from all walks of life, both industrial and academic. He has been the project manager of the internship program of the professional master's degree in computer science - artificial intelligence since its creation and is actively working on its development and its perpetuation. He is also interested in raising awareness of the ethical issues surrounding the secondary use of data, particularly in an industrial setting.

### Pierre Gravel

After completing a bachelor's degree in engineering physics (U. Laval) and working in dynamic simulation at CAE in Montreal, Pierre Gravel returned to school to study physics (M.Sc, U. of Montreal) and astrophysics (Phd, U. Toronto).

His passion for imaging and data analysis led him to The MathWorks, near Boston, to develop image analysis methods for Matlab. It was his love of French and homesickness that led him back to R&D and teaching in biomedical engineering and medical physics. He worked in various laboratories in Montreal (LIO and LCTI at Notre-Dame Hospital) and in Quebec City (CERVO center), in addition to teaching physics at CEGEP. During this period, he did two postdoctoral fellowships, one at L'ÉTS and the other at ENVA, in Paris. He also worked as a visiting lecturer and CNRS researcher (Institut de Biomécanique Humaine Georges Charpak at Arts et Métiers ParisTech) to teach image and data analysis and medical imaging. Before coming to IID, his most recent job was in industry where he worked in machine learning and deep learning (Genetec Inc., Montreal).

### Julien Laumonier

Julien Laumônier is the head of the scientific team at the Institute for Intelligence and Data (IID) of Laval University.

With a PhD in multi-agent reinforcement learning and more than 10 years of experience as an information technology consultant in the government sector, Julien Laumônier specialized in software architecture and development. Since his return to the research world, he has been interested in the ethics of artificial intelligence and the way organizations appropriate this new technology.

### Gabriel Leclerc 

Gabriel Leclerc completed a master's degree in AI at Laval University in partnership with the CERVO research center. He specialized in the application of deep neural network models to microscopy imaging. He has an interest in the application of artificial intelligence to both images and time series.
 
He is currently a research professional in AI in partnership with the Intelligence and Data Institute (IID) and the Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de services sociaux de la Capitale-Nationale (CIUSSS-CN). It provides AI support for the research projects of researchers from different research centers.
