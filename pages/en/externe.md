## Service to the External Community

### Service reserved for IID members and collaborators (for the moment)

If you are a member of the [Université Laval](https://www.ulaval.ca) community  but not yet a member or collaborator of the [Institute Intelligence and Data](https://iid.ulaval.ca) (or one of their students), we are currently developing the processes and methods to best meet your needs. We will make a public announcement when the service is more widely available.

If you are a professional and need help in developing your projects, there are several resources already available for you: 
* [PARI-CNRC](https://nrc.canada.ca/fr/soutien-linnovation-technologique) offers technology innovation support that may allow you to access our services. Please contact the NRC-IRAP officer in your area. 
* The [Master of Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ift.ulaval.ca/ia) at Université Laval has a mandatory internship program for which [you could propose a project](https://iid.ulaval.ca/miia).

Irrespective of your location, it is always possible to receive training:
* The [Direction de la Formation Continue](https://www.fsg.ulaval.ca/faculte/services-a-la-communaute-facultaire/vice-decanat-aux-etudes/formation-continue) of the [Faculté de Sciences et de Génie de l'Université Laval](https://www.fsg.ulaval.ca/) offers a [training package](https://www.brioeducation.ca/domaines/sciences-et-genie/) which will allow your staff to acquire the skills needed to develop your organization. You [find more information here](https://iid.ulaval.ca/services/#liste).
* We are in the process of identifying a set of free self-training courses (mostly in English) that we will update regularly: [Training](./formations.md)
