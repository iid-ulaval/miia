## Service to the External Community

### Service reserved for IID members and collaborators (for the moment)

If you are a member of the [Laval University] community (https://www.ulaval.ca) but not yet a member or collaborator of the [Institute for Intelligence and Data] (https://iid.ulaval.ca), we are currently developing the processes and methods to best meet your needs. We will make a public announcement when the service is more widely available.

If you are a professional and need help in developing your projects, there are several resources already available to you: 
* [NRC-IRAP](https://nrc.canada.ca/fr/soutien-linnovation-technologique) offers technology innovation support that may allow you to access our services. Please contact the NRC-IRAP officer in your region. 
* The [Master of Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ift.ulaval.ca/ia) at Laval University has a mandatory internship program for which [you could propose a project](https://iid.ulaval.ca/miia).

No matter where you come from, it is always possible to get training:
* The [Direction de la Formation Continue]() of the [Faculté de Sciences et de Génie de l'Université Laval]() offers a [training package]() to help your staff acquire the skills needed to develop your organization. You [find more information here]().
* We are in the process of identifying a set of free self-training courses (mostly in English) that we will update as we find them here : [Training](./pages/training.md)
