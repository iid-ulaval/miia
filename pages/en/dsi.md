## Introduction

It is possible to obtain goods or services from the various administrative units of Laval University, which then act as internal suppliers. An internal service request, commonly called ISR, must be completed in PeopleSoft.

To find out which administrative units require an ISR to be completed in order to provide a product or service, consult the "List of Internal Services" available on the Finance Department's website, in the section `Formation et pilotage de système` - `Documentation` - `Liste des services internes`.

## Internal Service Request (ISR)

The acquisition of goods or services from administrative units of Laval University is part of the general procurement. Therefore, the menus for entering, viewing and printing a service request are located under the heading  `Gestion des approvisionnements`.

### Accessing the form

To access the entry form, use the Internal Service Request link on the `Accueil utilisateur` page or target the following hierarchical menu and select the `Ajout valeur` tab.


── `Gestion approvisionnements`<br>&emsp;└── `Demandes achat`<br>&emsp;&emsp;└── `Demande Service Interne`


Or target the left menu, click the folder `Gestion approvisionnements`, then the subfolder `Demande d'achat` and then in the `Menu principal` click `Demande Service Interne`.

For the rest of the procedure, it is possible to consult the [guide of the Statistical Consultation Service of Laval University here](https://scs.mat.ulaval.ca/fileadmin/scs/documents/2015/Procedures_SCS-2018.pdf).
