## ULaval Community Service

### Intro

At this time we have identified the following service offering: 
* Audit/Code review
* Advice on methods and tools to be used
* Validation of the methodology 
* Advice on training

The service offer must be carried out within the framework of a research project and we ask any student wishing to consult us to contact the principal investigator (or a co-PI) of the project. 

### The steps 

1. [Contact via the form](https://forms.office.com/r/jhLM8nwZu8)
2. Make an appointment with the advisors
3. Meeting and discussion for project evaluation
4. Analysis by the counselling team
5. Resolution and meeting to discuss the result
6. Evaluation of the service for improvement

# Support team

Most of the counseling will be done by IID graduate students who have demonstrated their ability to provide such coaching. They will be supported by the IID's team of research professionals as well.

### Price

This service is part of [Laval University's Intelligence and Data Institute's mission](https://iid.ulaval.ca/a-propos/#Missions-et-objectifs), and as such, we do not charge for the first five (5) hours of consulting, which covers the first meeting, the assessment and the solution proposal meeting. 

Should the project take longer, an [internal service request (ISR)](./dsi.md) could be performed at the rate of $50/hr.

In the case of a particular match between the project to be evaluated and the student advisor's research project, mentoring activities leading to joint publications could also be considered.

### Service reserved for IID members and collaborators (for the moment)

If you are a member of the [Université Laval] community (https://www.ulaval.ca) but are not yet a member or collaborator of the [Institute for Intelligence and Data] (https://iid.ulaval.ca), we are currently developing the processes and methods to best meet your needs. We will make a public announcement when the service is more widely available.

Wherever you come from, it is also always possible to get training:
* The [Direction de la Formation Continue]() of the [Faculté de Sciences et de Génie de l'Université Laval]() offers a [training package]() to help your staff acquire the skills needed to develop your organization. You [find more information here]().
* We are in the process of identifying a set of free self-training courses (mostly in English) that we will update as we find them here : [Training](./pages/training.md)
