## IID AI and Data Consulting Service

### Introduction

Welcome to the website of the Service de consultation en intelligence et donn√©es (SCID) of Laval University.  The SCID makes available to the scientific community the knowledge and expertise of the research professionals of the [Intelligence and Data Institute (IID)](https://iid.ulaval.ca).

We offer our services to IID researchers and collaborators (and their students) to help them choose and use appropriate data modeling methods and tools, review the code developed, interpret and present the results of these methods and tools, participate in the implementation of new machine learning methods, or to perform analysis of unstructured experimental data.

For more classical mathematical or statistical modeling, we naturally refer applicants to the [Service de Consultation Statistique de l'Universit√© Laval](https://scs.mat.ulaval.ca/accueil/).

See the different sections below for a complete description of our services and pricing.

**Note COVID-19:** Consultations will be conducted mostly at a distance.

### Service reserved for IID members and collaborators (for the moment)

If you are a member of the [Laval University](https://www.ulaval.ca)  community but not yet a member or collaborator of the [Intelligence and Data Institute](https://iid.ulaval.ca) (or one of their students), we are currently developing the processes and methods to best meet your needs. We will make a public announcement when the service is more widely available.

If you are a professional and need help in developing your projects, there are several resources already available to you: 
* [PARI-CNRC](https://nrc.canada.ca/fr/soutien-linnovation-technologique) offers technology innovation support that may allow you to access our services. Please contact the NRC-IRAP officer in your region. 
* The [Master of Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ift.ulaval.ca/ia) at Laval University has a mandatory internship program for which [you could propose a project](https://iid.ulaval.ca/miia).

No matter where you come from, it is always possible to get training:
* The [Direction de la Formation Continue]() of the [Facult√© de Sciences et de G√©nie de l'Universit√© Laval]() offers a [training package]() to help your staff acquire the skills needed to develop your organization. You can [find more information here]().
* We are in the process of identifying a set of free self-training courses (mostly in English) that we will update as we find them here : [Training](./pages/formations.md)
