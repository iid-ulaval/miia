## ULaval Community Service

### Introduction

The following service offering is currently available: 
* Audit/Code review
* Advice on methods and tools to be used
* Validation of the methodology 
* Advice on training

The service offer must be carried out within the context of a research project and we ask any student wishing to consult us to begin by contacting the principal investigator (or a co-PI) of the project. 

### The steps 

1. [Contact the SCIAD team via the form](https://forms.office.com/r/jhLM8nwZu8)
2. Make an appointment with the advisors
3. Meeting and discussion for project evaluation
4. Analysis of your request by the counselling team
5. Proposal of a solution and meeting to discuss the result
6. Evaluation of the service for improvement

# Support team

The counseling will be offered by IID graduate students who have demonstrated their ability to provide such coaching. They will be supported by the IID team of research professionals.

### Price

This service is part of the mission of [Universit√© Laval and Institute Intelligence and Data](https://iid.ulaval.ca/a-propos/#Missions-et-objectifs), and as such, we do not charge for the first five (5) hours of consulting, which covers the first meeting, the assessment and the solution proposal meeting. 

Should the project take longer, an [internal service request (ISR)](./dsi.md) could be considered and will be offered at the rate of $50/hr.

If the project to be evaluated and the student advisor's research project closely match, mentoring activities leading to joint publications could also be considered.

### Service reserved for IID members and collaborators (for the moment)

If you are not affiliated with the [Institute Intelligence and Data](https://iid.ulaval.ca), please be aware of [our other support or training opportunities](./externe.md).
