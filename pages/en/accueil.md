### About us

Do you need knowledge and expertise in artificial intelligence and data science for research projects? Take advantage of the support of the AI and Data Consulting Service (SCIAD) at Laval University. 

Established in September 2022 by the [Intelligence and Data Institute (IDI)](https://iid.ulaval.ca) of Universit√© Laval, the SCIAD allows students linked to researchers who are members and collaborators of the Institute to access support from professionals or research assistants (graduate students) in order to help them in their use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms or data processing within the framework of a research project or initiative conducted at Universit√© Laval. 

Among the services offered by SCIAD:
* Needs analysis
* Audit and review of computer code
* Validation of AI methodology and data processing
* Reformulation of the problem in an appropriate language 
* Consulting services for the choice of methods or tools to be used in the project
* Advice on available and relevant training to explore

If you are looking for classical mathematical or statistical modeling services, you may want to contact the [Service de Consultation Statistique de l'Universit√© Laval](https://scs.mat.ulaval.ca/accueil/).
